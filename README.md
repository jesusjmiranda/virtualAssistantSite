# Virtual Assistant

This React application serves as the web front to a virtual secratary business. The application features a contact page
that is managed with firestore and a translation feature that I built with Context and translated myself. 

## Design

I designed the site layout and colorscheme and used Photoshop to obtain the company logo which was previously only available on a business card. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn ship`

This command initiates the build process then deploys the application to firebase once built.
